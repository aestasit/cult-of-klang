Sample Akka client/server application to reproduce "No sender future in scope" error.

./gradlew clean build jettyRun (or if you have gradle installed, just use gradle) to run the server

Open the project with Intellij Idea and run the "AkkaClient" class located and run the main method.

That should reproduce the error.
