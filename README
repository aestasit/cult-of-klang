Sample Akka client/server application to reproduce "No sender future in scope" error.

cd to "akka-remote"
./gradlew clean build jettyRun (or if you have gradle installed, just use gradle)

Open the project with Intellij Idea and run the "AkkaClient" class located in akka-application

That should reproduce the error.
